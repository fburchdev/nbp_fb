notes: The original 3 volumes of The Baroque Cycle listed above were also divided into multiple sub-volumes and sold as trade paperbacks under various titles. Cryptonomicon is loosely set in the same universe as the Baroque Cycle, and includes characters who are the descendants of those in the Baroque Cycle. It is a standalone work which may be read either before or after.
