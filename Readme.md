#Mission:

Help readers to discover the correct reading order of fiction series.
 
#Inspiration:

As a fan of genre fiction, I have frequently had to spend an inordinate amount time doing research to discover the correct order in which to read a series. Amazon only provides this information in a piecemeal and inconsistent fashion. Sometimes I have found it in forums on Amazon, sometimes on author websites or Wikipedia. This project seeks to provide a better solution to that problem.
